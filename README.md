# mcp-pitchprotocol

Pitch Protocol — agent-native venture-capital infrastructure (pitchprotocol.vc).

Part of [Pipeworx](https://pipeworx.io) — an MCP gateway connecting AI agents to 1576+ live data sources.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pitchprotocol_schema` | Get the LIVE Pitch Protocol pitch-application schema — the exact fields, character limits, enums, and a complete example a founder (or AI agent) must fill to pitch AI-agent / agent-native startups to matched VC funds via pitchprotocol.vc. Use for "how do I pitch Pitch Protocol", "what does an agent-native VC application require", or before assembling a submission. Returns the authoritative schema (company/sectors/traction/team/raise/governance, submitterType humanFounder\|aiAgent\|aiFounded). Submission is completed through Pitch Protocol's own email-verified flow. |
| `pitchprotocol_application_status` | Check the status of a Pitch Protocol pitch application by its id (draft \| intake \| submitted, plus research progress). Read-only — use to track a submission you have already created via Pitch Protocol's flow. |

## Quick Start

Add to your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pitchprotocol": {
      "url": "https://gateway.pipeworx.io/pitchprotocol/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### What this endpoint actually serves

`tools/list` at `https://gateway.pipeworx.io/pitchprotocol/mcp` returns the tools in the table
above **plus the shared Pipeworx meta-tools** — `ask_pipeworx`,
`discover_tools`, `search_within`, `remember`/`recall` and the rest of the
gateway-wide set. So the tool count you see is larger than this table: a
single-pack endpoint currently lists roughly 30 shared tools alongside the
pack's own. The connection's `initialize` response states its exact scope, and
is the authoritative answer for a given day.

This is deliberate, not multiplexing by accident. The meta-tools are what let a
scoped connection answer a question this pack does not cover — via
`ask_pipeworx`, which routes across the whole catalog — without you adding a
second MCP server. There is currently no way to mount a pack endpoint without
them; if the extra schemas cost you more context than the routing is worth,
connect to the full gateway once rather than to several pack endpoints.

Or connect to the full Pipeworx gateway to get every pack's tools listed
directly, instead of just this one's:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipeworx": {
      "url": "https://gateway.pipeworx.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Both URLs reach the same gateway and the same 1576+ data sources. The
only difference is which pack's tools are listed **directly**; `ask_pipeworx`
reaches all of them from either one.

## Standalone (no gateway account)

This package also runs as a local stdio MCP server — no Pipeworx account, no
gateway round-trip:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pitchprotocol": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@pipeworx/mcp-pitchprotocol"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or run it directly to confirm it starts:

```bash
npx -y @pipeworx/mcp-pitchprotocol
```

It speaks MCP over stdin/stdout and answers `initialize`/`tools/list`/`tools/call`
for **only** this pack's tools — none of the shared meta-tools the gateway
connection above adds. Same source, same tools, no ask_pipeworx routing.

## Using with ask_pipeworx

Instead of calling tools directly, you can ask questions in plain English —
this works on the pack endpoint above as well as on the full gateway:

```
ask_pipeworx({ question: "your question about Pitchprotocol data" })
```

The gateway picks the right tool and fills the arguments automatically.
